## Why Is My Hot Water Faucet Leaking?  
A leaking hot water faucet is more than just an annoyanceâ€”it can lead to higher water bills, wasted energy, and potential water damage. Common causes include:  
- **Worn-out washers or O-rings**: Over time, these components degrade, causing leaks.  
- **Loose or damaged valve seat**: The connection between the faucet and the spout can wear out.  
- **Corroded pipes or fittings**: Mineral buildup or rust can create leaks.  
- **High water pressure**: Excessive pressure can strain your faucetâ€™s components.  

Ignoring a leak can lead to more significant plumbing issues, so addressing it promptly is essential.
