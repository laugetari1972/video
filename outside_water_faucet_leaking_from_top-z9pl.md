3. **Disassembling the Faucet**: I carefully remove the handle and other components to access the internal mechanism.
4. **Replacing Faulty Parts**: Depending on the issue, I replace worn-out washers, O-rings, or other damaged parts.

## Tips for Preventing Future Leaks

To avoid recurring issues with your outdoor faucet, consider these tips:

- **Regular Maintenance**: Inspect your faucets periodically for signs of wear or leaks.
- **Winterization**: Before colder months, disconnect hoses and insulate outdoor faucets to prevent freezing and cracking.
- **Use Quality Parts**: Invest in durable washers and O-rings to ensure longevity.
- **Avoid Over-Tightening**: Tightening the faucet handle too much can damage the internal components.
