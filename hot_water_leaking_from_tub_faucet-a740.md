## Common Causes of a Leaking Tub Faucet  
A hot water leak from your tub faucet can be frustrating and wasteful. Understanding the root cause is the first step toward resolving the issue. Common culprits include:  
- **Worn-out washers or O-rings**: Over time, these small components deteriorate, causing leaks.  
- **Loose or damaged valve stems**: Improperly tightened or corroded stems can lead to water seepage.  
- **Cracked or damaged pipes**: Age or wear can cause pipes to develop leaks.  
- **Faulty faucet cartridge**: A damaged or misaligned cartridge can prevent the faucet from sealing properly.  

Identifying the exact issue requires a professional assessment to avoid further damage or unnecessary repairs.  

## Benefits of Fixing a Leaking Tub Faucet  
Addressing a leaking tub faucet promptly offers several advantages:  
1. **Saves Water**: A small leak can waste hundreds of gallons of water annually, increasing your utility bills.  
2. **Prevents Damage**: Leaks can lead to mold, mildew, or structural damage to your bathroom.  
3. **Improves Efficiency**: A properly functioning faucet ensures consistent water pressure and temperature.  
4. **Enhances Safety**: Eliminating leaks reduces the risk of slips or falls due to water pooling.

3. **Disassembly**: The faucet is carefully disassembled to access the internal components.  
4. **Replacement or Repair**: Damaged parts are replaced, or faulty components are repaired.  
5. **Reassembly and Testing**: The faucet is reassembled, and the water supply is restored to test for leaks.  

## Tips to Prevent Future Leaks
