## Step-by-Step Faucet Repair Process

1. **Inspection and Diagnosis**  
   A professional plumber will first inspect your faucet to identify the root cause of the issue, whether itâ€™s a worn-out washer, a faulty cartridge, or mineral buildup.  

2. **Shutting Off the Water Supply**  
   To avoid leaks or spills during the repair, the water supply to the faucet will be temporarily turned off.  

3. **Disassembling the Faucet**  
   The plumber will carefully take apart the faucet to access the damaged or malfunctioning components.  

4. **Replacing Faulty Parts**  
   Worn-out washers, O-rings, cartridges, or other parts will be replaced with high-quality, durable replacements.  

5. **Cleaning and Reassembling**  
   Any mineral buildup or debris will be cleaned, and the faucet will be reassembled to ensure smooth operation.  

6. **Testing and Quality Check**  
   The plumber will turn the water supply back on and test the faucet to confirm the repair was successful and there are no leaks.
