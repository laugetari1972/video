### Step-by-Step Guide

4. **Install the New Faucet**:  
   - Insert the faucet through the mounting hole(s) on the sink.  
   - Secure it with the mounting hardware provided in the kit.  
5. **Connect the Supply Lines**: Attach the hot and cold water supply lines to the corresponding valves. Use plumberâ€™s tape on the threads to prevent leaks.  
6. **Check for Leaks**: Turn the water supply back on and test the faucet for any leaks. Tighten connections if necessary.  
7. **Final Adjustments**: Ensure the swivel spout and handle operate smoothly.  

### Tips for a Successful Installation  
- Always double-check the alignment of the faucet before tightening the mounting hardware.
